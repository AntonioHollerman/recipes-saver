# Recipes Saver
___
Created this 'Recipes' project to store/save any recipe you find on the internet and input both relevant info on the 
recipe and an image for it. I used the project to save recipes I found interesting from the internet to later cook in 
my free time. Project allowed me to practice utilizing SQLite databases and tkinter for GUI development. I also learned 
how to incorporate images into tkinter.
